    "#### Defining a sampler\n",
    "\n",
    "A Gibbs sampler is composed of a list of $p$ distributions $P(.|\\mathcal{S_t})$, where $\\mathcal{S_t}$ is the internal state of the sampler.\n",
    "\n",
    "each $P(.|S_t)$ computes the value of its attached parameter using the current values of the parameters stored in the state. For example, if you have a model with three parameters, $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\theta$, where \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\alpha \\sim \\mathcal{N}(.5 * \\beta, \\theta)$$\n",
    "$$\\beta \\sim \\mathcal{G}(\\alpha, \\theta)$$\n",
    "$$\\theta \\sim \\mathcal{IG}(\\alpha/2, \\beta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "then the Gibbs sampler describing that setup would use the conditional distributions:\n",
    "$$ P(\\alpha_{t+1} | \\beta_t, \\theta_t)$$\n",
    "$$ P(\\beta_{t+1} | \\alpha_{t+1}, \\theta_t)$$\n",
    "$$ P(\\theta_{t+1} | \\alpha_{t+1}, \\beta_{t+1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The ordered set of these distributions is called $\\mathcal{P}$.  Also, let us say there are $p$ elements in $\\mathcal{P}$. The order of elements in $\\mathcal{P}$ is arbitrary, in theory, but any implementation will likely structure the order to help memoize certain expensive computations. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Moving around\n",
    "\n",
    "With this, we can define the following terms:\n",
    "- cycles : $t$, the number times all of the conditional posteriors $P_i \\in \\mathcal{P}$ have been executed.\n",
    "- position : the index of the current conditional posterior $P_i$ in $\\mathcal{P}$\n",
    "- steps : the number of cycles times the number of positions in a cycle, that is, the total number of draws from any $P_i$. It is always equal to $cycles * p + position$.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this, we can define a few types of cycles and give some meaning to the parameter sets that come out of the process:\n",
    "- full cycle: a cycle where the starting and ending positions are the same\n",
    "- partial cycle: a cycle where the starting and ending positions are not the same\n",
    "- perfect cycle: a cycle where the ending position is zero\n",
    "- draw : a number or set of numbers drawn from $P_i$, where $i = position$. A draw where only one $P_i$ is used is called a 'step'.\n",
    "- sample : some number, $d$, of draws.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any type of cycle is also a type of sample. Thus, a full perfect sample is one drawn from a cycle that starts and ends at 0. The easiest way to get $s$ samples from the Gibbs sampler is to simply make $s$ full perfect cycles and record the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using the sampler\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, let us call our sampler `G`. At its start, it has a position of $0$, and has taken $0$ steps. If the user runs `G.step()`. it will compute a draw of $P_0$ and increment the position by one. If we have more than one $P_i \\in \\mathcal{P}$, it will take a partial perfect cycle to get a full sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the current parameter values, the most recent draws are stored by default in the sampler state, `G._state`. The set of most recent draws, either in the current cycle or in the previous cycle, is called the *front* of the sampler, or the front sample. That is, its draws constitute a full imperfect sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "The *current* sample is a full perfect sample. It contains the draws that have already been taken in the current cycle, and `None` for draws in the cycle that have not occurred. Likewise, the *previous* sample is a full perfect sample from the previous cycle. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is important, since the Gibbs sampler uses the *front* parameters, which is just the of the *current* and *previous* parmeters.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is actually subclass of a dictionary, and you can do anything with it that you can do with a dictionary. But, it makes its elements available in dot notation as well. So, the following are both valid ways to retrieve something from the sampler state: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "G._state.Betas\n",
    "G._state['Betas']\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you try to store something that would override a dict property or attribute (like `update` or `clear`), a `TypeError` is raised. "
